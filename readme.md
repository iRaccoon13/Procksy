# Procksy
The best way to bypass web fillters utilizing browser extensions. 

## Usage
When run, the inedex page will ask for the root URL of what you are accessing, i.e. `https://blo0ckedsite.com/`. This will be stored in a cookie, allowing the server to access it to make the procksy requests.

It is still extremely easy to blo0ck this tool altogether, so I've created [Mini-Browser Mode](mini-browser-mode-unblo0ckable).
